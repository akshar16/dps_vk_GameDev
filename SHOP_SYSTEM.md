### Key Variables
```python
self.coins = 0                    # Player currency
self.shop_open = False           # Shop menu state
self.nearby_shop = False         # Player in interaction range
self.shop_sprite = Shop(...)     # Reference to Shop NPC sprite

# pygame_gui components
self.ui_manager = UIManager(...)  # pygame_gui manager
self.shop_window = UIWindow(...)  # Main shop window
self.shop_buttons = []            # List of item purchase buttons
self.shop_close_button = UIButton(...) # Close button

self.shop_items = [              # Available items
    {"name": "Health Pack", "price": 5, "description": "Restore 5 HP"},
    {"name": "Max HP Upgrade", "price": 10, "description": "+5 Max HP"},

## Gameplay Flow

   - Player defeats enemies to earn coins
   - Coins counter visible at all times
   - Shop NPC is always visible on the map

2. **Approaching Shop**:
   - When within 100 pixels, "Press E to open shop" appears
   - Shop sprite continues animating

3. **Shopping**:
   - Press E to open GUI window
   - Mouse cursor becomes visible
   - Game pauses (no movement/shooting/enemy attacks)
   - Click item buttons to purchase
   - Window refreshes to show updated coin balance

## Notes

- **pygame_gui Library**: Provides professional UI components with themes, animations, and mouse interaction
- **Custom Theme**: Dark blue and gold color scheme matches the game's aesthetic
- **Responsive Buttons**: Visual feedback shows which items are affordable vs too expensive
- Shop is far from player spawn (Y=287 vs player Y=1945) - player must travel to reach it
- Shop has no collision - purely visual/interactive
- Multiple purchases stack (e.g., buying Speed Boost twice = +100 speed)
- Victory condition remains at 400 coins (same as old score system)
- Shop window pauses all gameplay including enemy movement and attacks
- GUI can be closed via X button, Close button, or ESC key
- Window is draggable for player convenience
